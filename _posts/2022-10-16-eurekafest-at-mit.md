In November 2022, eight other friends and I were thrilled to learn that we were selected as winners of a 2021-2022 Lemelson-MIT Inventeams $10,000 grant for our novel invention, BuzzBand. BuzzBand is a vibrating armband aimed to aid youth across the autism spectrum with focus and motivation while exercising. We were so honored to be selected as one of eight national winners! 

In addition to allowing us to continue prototyping with more resources, Lemelson-MIT also offered our team the oppurtunity to stay at MIT's campus to participate in a 3-day Eurekafest, a celebration invention and opputunity for us to present our invention at the MIT lecture halls in front of hundreds of people. 

I had so much fun hearing about cool inventions from my other peers and meeting so many new people on campus. For an extended version of my Eurekafest times, check out the [blog that I posted on our team website](http://girlsofsteelrobotics.com/news/girls-of-steel-inventeams-update-8-eurekafest/).
