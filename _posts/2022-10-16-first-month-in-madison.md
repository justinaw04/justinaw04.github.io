Yesterday's football game against the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign officially marked the end of my first month living in Madison! As a cheese-lover in America's dairyland, I've had quite a time. 

Here are some highlights: 
* **September 1:** My new friends and I watched the sunset at Memorial Union by Lake Mendota.

* **September 2** The class of '26 created the logo in our football stadium, Camp Randall.

* **September 6** Convocation at the Kohl Center! Turns out the class of '26 is the biggest freshman class in UW-Madison history.

* **September 17** I went to Dane County Farmers' Market on Capitol Square and tried cheese curds for the first time. Yes, the hype is very real and justified.

* **September 23** We went to the volleyball game against Northwestern at the Field House. We won in three sets, _yawn_.

Even though I've only been in college for a short amount of time, I've already met so many future life-long best friends and incredible professors and teaching staff. I'm looking forward to the rest of the year and battling the infamous Wisconsin winter, On Wisconsin!
