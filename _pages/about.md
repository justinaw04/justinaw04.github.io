Hello! I am a first year Ph.D. student in Computer Science and Learning Sciences at Northwestern University. I am interested in exploring the intersection of human-computer interaction and pedagogy to design more equitable and engaging learning environments.

In May 2025, I graduated with honors from UW-Madison with a degree in Computer Science and a minor in Educational Sciences. During my time as an undergraduate researcher, I focused on designing social robots and interfaces for family and home-based learning.
