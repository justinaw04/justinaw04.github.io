Hello, welcome to my page!

This website shows some of my random stuff in programming, robotics, and other cool parts of my life. 

I was born in Berkeley, California, grew up in Pittsburgh, Pennslyvania, and now live in Madison, Wisconsin. In high school, I was a member and lead of [Girls of Steel](http://girlsofsteelrobotics.com/blog/), an all girls robotics team at Carnegie Mellon University.
